‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH CONFIDENCE CRITICAL ISSUES: Immediate action required. These issues would likely fail regulatory audit.

======================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS (Sorted by Confidence)
======================================================================

üî¥ [21 CFR Part 11] System Validation
   Confidence: 95%
   Context: "[Section: The AI will check for compliance with:] Paste your clinical trial protocol text here for analysis. The AI will check for compliance with: - ..."
   AI Analysis: The text does not provide any information regarding the completion of system validation, and there are no documented IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), or PQ (Performance Qualification) reports mentioned. It instead describes what the AI will check for but does not address any validation protocols, test scripts, or qualification reports that would demonstrate compliance with 21 CFR Part 11.10(a). This absence of validation documentation represents a severe violation of regulatory requirements. Specific concern: Complete lack of information on system validation, including IQ/OQ/PQ documentation.
   ‚Üí Action: Address System Validation requirements for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
   üìñ Reference: 21 CFR ¬ß11.10(a)

üî¥ [Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6)] Protocol Compliance
   Confidence: 95%
   Context: "[Section: The AI will check for compliance with:] Paste your clinical trial protocol text here for analysis. The AI will check for compliance with: - ..."
   AI Analysis: The text does not demonstrate any actual protocol compliance or details about deviations, as it only describes the AI's role in checking for compliance across various regulations without outlining any investigator responsibilities or processes related to protocol adherence. There is no mention of documenting or reporting deviations as required by ICH E6 Section 4.5, which indicates a severe gap in fulfilling the necessary standards for GCP and regulatory requirements. Specific concern: Complete lack of information on protocol compliance, deviation documentation, and investigator responsibilities.
   ‚Üí Action: Address Protocol Compliance requirements for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6) compliance
   üìñ Reference: See applicable regulations

üî¥ [ONC HTI-1] Data Transparency
   Confidence: 95%
   Context: "Paste your clinical trial protocol text here for analysis. The AI will check for compliance with: - HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules - 21 CFR Part 11 ..."
   AI Analysis: The text does not provide any information about data transparency, data sharing mechanisms, or clinical trial registration, which are essential components of ONC HTI-1 requirements. Instead, it only states that the AI will check for compliance with various regulations without detailing how data will be shared transparently or how the trial will be registered. This lack of specific information and implementation illustrates a severe violation of the ONC HTI-1 transparency rules. Specific concern: Complete lack of information on data transparency and clinical trial registration as required by ONC HTI-1.
   ‚Üí Action: Address Data Transparency requirements for ONC HTI-1 compliance
   üìñ Reference: 85 FR 25642

======================================================================
PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================
üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
  ‚Ä¢ [21 CFR Part 11] Address System Validation requirements for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance (Confidence: 95%)
  ‚Ä¢ [Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6)] Address Protocol Compliance requirements for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6) compliance (Confidence: 95%)
  ‚Ä¢ [ONC HTI-1] Address Data Transparency requirements for ONC HTI-1 compliance (Confidence: 95%)

üìä NEXT STEPS:
  1. Review all high-confidence findings with compliance team
  2. Prioritize critical and violation-level issues
  3. Document remediation plans with timelines
  4. Schedule follow-up compliance assessment
  5. Consider external audit for validation
